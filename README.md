## Introduction

The HTTP Request with Basic Authentication program is written in Rust and uses the `reqwest` crate to send an HTTP GET request to a server. It demonstrates how to add basic authentication credentials to the request, allowing you to access protected resources.

## How it Works

This program performs the following steps:

1. Creates an instance of the `reqwest::blocking::Client` to manage the HTTP request.
2. Specifies the username and password for basic authentication. In this example, the username is "testuser," and the password is not provided (`None`).
3. Sends an HTTP GET request to "http://httpbin.org/get" using the specified client and includes basic authentication headers.
4. Receives the response from the server and prints it to the console.

## Usage

To use the HTTP Request with Basic Authentication program, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system.

2. Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/http-request-auth.git
   cd http-request-auth
   ```

3. Build and run the program:

   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

   This will execute the program, send an HTTP GET request with basic authentication, and display the response on the console.
